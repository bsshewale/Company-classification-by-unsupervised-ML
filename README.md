# Company-classification-by-unsupervised-ML

# Important stages of project are:
1. Know Your Data
2. Understanding Your Variables
3. Data Wrangling
4. Feature Engineering & Data Pre-processing
   1. Looking at special characters in our data
   2. Text Cleaning
   3. Removing emoji and convert visually similar character to latin
   4. Text cleaning function
   5. Removing number from text
   6. Saving cleaned file into csv file
5. Vectorization
   1. Creating vectorizer object
6. Data Vizualization, Storytelling & Experimenting with charts
   1. Making Clusters
   2. ML Model Implementation
   3. Showing the wordcloud
7. Conclusion
   1. In this way first of all doing preprocessing of the dataset, next doing the cleaning and using the machine learning models the companies are classified based on the important words found.
   2. KMeansTF model is used for the determination of the number of the cluster.
